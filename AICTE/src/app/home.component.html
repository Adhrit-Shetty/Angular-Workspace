          <p>
            Technical education in India contributes a major share to the overall education system and
            plays a vital role in the social and economic development of our nation. In India, technical
            education is imparted at various levels such as: craftsmanship, diploma, degree,
            post-graduate and research in specialized fields, catering to various aspects of
            technological development and economic progress.

          <p>
            The beginning of formal Technical Education in India can be dated back to the mid 19th
            Century. The major policy initiatives in the pre-independence period included appointment of
            the Indian Universities Commission in 1902, issue of the Indian Education policy resolution
            in 1904 and the Governor General’s policy statement of 1913 stressing the importance of
            Technical Education, the establishment of IISc in Bangalore, Institute for Sugar, Textile
            and Leather Technology in Kanpur, N.C.E. in Bengal in 1905 and Industrial schools in several
            provinces. Significant developments include:
